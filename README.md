# widget-pubsubviewer
This widget can be used to attach a set of menu items to a parent widget's upper right corner menu to show the backing Github URL, a forking link, test links, and the inline pubsub viewer which lets you see what signals this widget publishes and subscribes to as well as documentation on the methods/properties inside the parent widget.
